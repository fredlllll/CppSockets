# Cross-platform C++ Sockets

This repository contains cross platform C++ classes and example code for using sockets on
Linux and Windows. Examples are in the /example directory

## Compiling

It's using cmake, so you have to look up how to use it for your toolset as there is too much variation to list them all

### Example on linux

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`
